# visualfreq
RGB visualization of frequency with arduino
for my first Hackathon, my group used a sound detector and a strip of addressable RGB LEDs to visualize frequencies on a range from
about 80 hz to 4100 hz. In addition, we also used RGB LEDs to visualize the intensity of sounds.

Visualfreq.ino is the program that uses FFT to show the different frequencies and their individual intensities.

LEDvolume.ino is the program that visualizes the intensisty of sounds.
